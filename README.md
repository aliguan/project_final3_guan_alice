1. [Marquee jQuery Plugin](https://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee)
    - To use the marquee plugin you add the class "marquee" to any div. This can be viewed on my Order form page.
2. [fullPage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/)
    - This plugin can be viewed on my homepage. The plugin makes specific sections of your page the full size of the browser. The different sections can be seen as a slider if you implement the horizontal code the documentation provides.

Thanks Richard! I learned a lot in this class. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to start on the path of becoming a Full-Stack developer. Maybe some languages to start off with? Thanks!
